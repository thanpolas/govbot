for your convenience when developing on your local. Needed environment variables
can be found on `.env-template` which you should copy to `.env` and edit.

## Snapshot.org Webhook

POST /snapshot-webhook
```

## Twitter Tokens

Follow this guide to get twitter tokens:

1. From the account you want the tweets to happen [apply for a Developer Account][twitter-apply]. This will take about a day and they might ask for followup questions.
1. Once you have your developer account approved, [go to the developer portal and create an application][twitter-portal], do not mark down any keys or tokens at this step, just create the app.
1. Once the app is created and you see it on your dashboard, you should see two icons, a "cog" (App settings) and a "key" (Keys and tokens).
1. Click on the Cog (App Settings).
1. Edit the "App Permissions" and make sure the permissions are "Read and Write".
1. Go back to the Dashboard and click on the "key icon" (Keys and tokens).
1. Regenerate your "consumer keys" and note both keys and values down in a safe and temporary document.
1. Regenerate the "Access Token and Secret" and note both keys and values down in a safe and temporary document.

With the keys available, you now need to populate the following environmental variables:

-   `TWITTER_CONSUMER_KEY=...`
-   `TWITTER_CONSUMER_SECRET=...`
-   `TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN=...`
-   `TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET=...`

## Discord Bot Tokens

Follow this guide to create your discord bot and get the tokens:

1. Go to the developer portal: https://discord.com/developers/applications
1. Create Application.
1. Go to "Bot" Menu and add expected permissions.
1. Go to "OAuth2" menu and select the "bot" scope.
1. Copy the OAuth2 URL and paste it on the browser.
1. Help on creating a bot: https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/discord.html

With the bot token available, you now need to populate the following environment variable:

-   `DISCORD_GOV_CHANNEL_ID`
