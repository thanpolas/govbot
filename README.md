# Discord Bot Template

> Describe what your bot does

# Getting Started

You need to edit the following files:

-   [ ] `.env-template` and copy as `.env`
-   [ ] `package.json` - Specifically, define the "database_name" key. This name will be used to create two databases when you run the local db reset npm scripts:"dbname-dev" and "dbname-test".
-   [ ] `.circleci/config.yml`
-   [ ] `config/**` (all configurations).

# How To Install

```
git clone git@github.com:thanpolas/discord-bot-template.git

cd discord-bot-template

npm i
```

## Update Env variables with the bot tokens

1. Copy `.env-template` to `.env` and fill in the required values.
1. Update env variables on the project.

## Prepare Docker

If you need database support, use the Docker and docker-compose, configurations
so you will need to install the [Docker Desktop][docker-desktop] package
on your local machine.

Once that is done, enter the working directory and type:

```
docker-compose up -d
```

[More on all `docker-compose` available commands][docker-compose].

## Needed Environment Variables

All targets require the following environment variables (add new as needed):

-   `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN` The Discord token of the bot.

This project also supports a [`.env` file][dotenv] which is on `.gitignore`
for your convenience when developing on your local.

# Development Operations / Maintenance

## Reset Local Database

```
npm run db:reset:local
```

## Database Migration Commands

### Create a New Migration Script

```
npm run knex:create_migration <name of migration>
```

### Run Migrations

```
npm run knex:migrate
```

## Running Tests Locally

Use the `jest` command to run all tests or specific ones.

### Reset Test Database

The tests will look for the `NUKE_TEST_DB` environment variable to be set to
initiate the test database nuking and re-population, use it like so:

```bash
NUKE_TEST_DB=1 jest
```

## Update Node Version

When a new node version is available you need to updated it in the following:

-   `/package.json`
-   `/.nvmrc`
-   `/.circleci/config.yml`
-   `/Dockerfile`

# Deployment

TBD
